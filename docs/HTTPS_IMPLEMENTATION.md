# HTTPS Termination Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ **HTTPS Features Successfully Implemented**

### üîí **TLS/SSL Server Support**
- **Full HTTPS Listener**: FerraGate now supports native HTTPS termination
- **Dual Protocol Support**: Runs both HTTP and HTTPS simultaneously
- **Automatic HTTP/2**: HTTPS connections automatically support HTTP/2
- **Modern TLS**: Uses TLS 1.3 with secure cipher suites (AEAD-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256)

### üìú **Certificate Management**
- **Custom Certificate Support**: Load your own PEM-format certificates and private keys
- **Self-signed Certificate Generation**: Built-in command to generate development certificates
- **Auto-generation**: Automatically generates certificates if none are found
- **Flexible Paths**: Configurable certificate and key file locations

### üåê **HTTPS Listener Configuration**
- **Configurable Ports**: Separate HTTP and HTTPS port configuration
- **HTTP to HTTPS Redirect**: Automatic 308 permanent redirects from HTTP to HTTPS
- **Host Header Handling**: Proper host header management for redirects
- **Production Ready**: Suitable for production with proper certificates

## üõ†Ô∏è **Configuration Structure**

### TLS Configuration Block
```toml
[server.tls]
enabled = true                      # Enable/disable HTTPS
port = 443                         # HTTPS port (default: 443)  
cert_file = "certs/server.crt"     # Certificate file path
key_file = "certs/server.key"      # Private key file path
redirect_http = true               # Enable HTTP to HTTPS redirect
```

### Certificate Generation Command
```bash
ferragate gen-certs --hostname localhost --output-dir certs
```

## üìã **Implementation Details**

### New Dependencies Added
- `axum-server`: HTTPS server support with Rustls
- `rustls`: Modern TLS implementation
- `rustls-pemfile`: PEM certificate parsing
- `tokio-rustls`: Async TLS support
- `rcgen`: Self-signed certificate generation

### New Modules Created
- `src/tls.rs`: TLS configuration loading and certificate generation
- CLI command: `gen-certs` for certificate generation

### Enhanced Configuration
- Extended `ServerConfig` with optional `TlsConfig`
- Added validation for TLS certificate files
- Updated default configuration examples

### Server Architecture
- **Concurrent Servers**: HTTP and HTTPS run simultaneously in separate tasks
- **Graceful Handling**: Proper error handling and server lifecycle management
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for TLS operations and server status

## ‚úÖ **Verification Tests Passed**

1. **HTTP Redirect Test**: ‚úÖ HTTP properly redirects to HTTPS (308 status)
2. **HTTPS Health Check**: ‚úÖ HTTPS health endpoint responds correctly
3. **HTTPS Proxy Test**: ‚úÖ Reverse proxy works over HTTPS
4. **POST Request Test**: ‚úÖ POST requests with JSON body work over HTTPS
5. **Certificate Generation**: ‚úÖ Self-signed certificates generate successfully
6. **TLS Handshake**: ‚úÖ TLS 1.3 handshake completes successfully
7. **HTTP/2 Support**: ‚úÖ Automatic HTTP/2 negotiation works

## üöÄ **Usage Examples**

### Development Setup (Self-signed)
```bash
# Generate certificates
ferragate gen-certs --hostname localhost

# Start server with HTTPS
ferragate start --config gateway.toml

# Test endpoints
curl -k https://localhost:8443/health           # Health check
curl -k https://localhost:8443/get/anything     # Proxy test
```

### Production Setup (Let's Encrypt)
```toml
[server.tls]
enabled = true
cert_file = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem"
key_file = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem"
redirect_http = true
```

## üéØ **Next Steps for Full API Gateway**

While HTTPS termination is now complete, these features would make FerraGate a comprehensive API gateway:

1. **Load Balancing**: Multiple upstream support with health checks
2. **Authentication**: JWT, OAuth2, API key validation
3. **Rate Limiting**: Request throttling and quotas
4. **WebSocket Support**: WebSocket proxy capabilities
5. **Caching**: Response caching layer
6. **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics and observability

The HTTPS foundation is now solid and production-ready! üîí‚ú®
